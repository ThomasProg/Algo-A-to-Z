There are as many vertices on the right as on the left We project the first vertex and the chosen vertex on the axis We select the vertex with the minimum projection, and evaluate in which direction the real minimum projection is We take the part of the circle between the first vertex and the chosen vertex that is in the direction of the minimum We repeat the algorithm, with the chosen vertex being the new last one A convex shape, that has a lot of vertices at one place We project the vertices ; the chosen vertex has the minimal projection We compute the direction of the real minimal projection We keep the part of the circle that was in that direction, and repeat Projecting an arbitrary 2D shape The brute force way An arbitrary shape can be constructed with the function S(t), described above. The brute force way of projecting the shape is just to project every point returned by that function. Of course, it is impossible to project every point. That is why we set a precision.\nInfo This method does not return the exact projection of the shape, but it is the best we can do without any more precisions on the shape.

However, the precision can be very accurate because of the depth we can easily increase thanks to the O(log(n)) complexity of the algorithm.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Projecting Shapes","uri":"/collisions/narrowphase/sat/projectshapes/index.html"},{"content":" Algorithms This repository contains a list of algorithms.\nEach algorithm has explainations and an associated code.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Projects","uri":"/index.html"},{"content":" Physics Broad Phase List of broad phases : ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Broad Phase","uri":"/collisions/broadphase/index.html"},{"content":" Why: Whether it is for 2D or 3D games, collisions are used a lot.\nEven the oldest games, like Tetris and Pacman, have some sort of collisions.\nAfter all this time, developers have found ways to simulate even more complex collisions :\nBox2D is opensource and was made by Erin Catto, but is not 3D PhysX was made by NVidia, but was discontinued Bullet, a 3D opensource collision library Chaos, recently developed by Unreal Engine Havok, used by Nintendo, Ubisoft, and others, but being premium Jolt Physics, a new 3D opensource used Horizon Forbidden West And more… However, since the old days, new ways to represent shapes are being used:\n2D boxes, moving freely (example : Mario) 2D Sprite pixels, for pixel to pixel collisions Complex 2D shapes, with multiple points 3D triangles, the mainstream way to represent 3D models Sign Distance Functions, being mathematical expressions of a shape And even more… The way to handle collisions is still evolving.

} } return true; } Note that this code is still doing the same thing as what we had before.\nHere, the Minkowski shape is just computed before the loop, and then projecting it, instead of getting the projections on the fly.\nThe condition also became very straightforward.\nConclusion Let A and B be two closed convex shapes.\nWe just proved that:\n“If two convex shapes do not collide, then, a hyperplane can separate them.”\nIs strictly equivalent to:\n“If the shapes are not colliding, then, the origin is inside the Minkowski sum A - B.”\nAnd a convex shape is defined by its tangent hyperplanes.\nSo we can just verify if the origin is “inside” the hyperplanes.\nThat proof works for any euclidean space!!!\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Minkowski And SAT","uri":"/collisions/narrowphase/sat/minkowskiandsat/index.html"},{"content":" The basic SAT algorithm We saw previously that the SAT could be explained using the Minkowski sum.\nC++ bool TestCollisionsWithSAT(const Shape\u0026 shape1, const Shape\u0026 shape2) { std::vector\u003cVector\u003e axes = GetEveryAxisInTheWholeWorld();

} } return true; } However, the problem with that is that we have to compute the sum of Minkowski.\nThe obvious way would be to compute possible points and then to create a convex hull around them.\nA convex hull can be created for any dimension with the QuickHull algorithm.\nAn implementation is available here : https://github.com/akuukka/quickhull/blob/master/QuickHull.cpp\nIt would then look like this:\nC++ Shape MinkowskiSum(const Shape\u0026 shape1, const Shape\u0026 shape2) { std::vector\u003cPoints\u003e points;

} } return Shape(QuickHull(points)); } Optimizing We could try using the property of convex shapes to :\nreduce the number of points as the source of the convex hull compute the convex hull even faster with a different algorithm (or maybe even directly) Another thing we could do is, rather than computing the convex hull, we could try directly computing the normals.\nAfter all, that’s what we are doing already in 2D and in 3D.\nThese possible optimizations have not been proven yet, and it’s not sure it is actually possible.\nBut the inverse is also true.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Minkowski And Axes","uri":"/collisions/narrowphase/sat/minkoswkiandaxes/index.html"},{"content":" Continuous collision for non rotating shapes If the shapes don’t have any angular velocity, we can consider their separating axis never change.\nWe have both shapes projected on an axis;
