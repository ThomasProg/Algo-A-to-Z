Collisions
</h1>
</div>

<h2> Why: </h2>
Whether it is for <b>2D or 3D</b> games, <b>collisions</b> are used <b>a lot</b>.
</br> 
Even the oldest games, like Tetris and Pacman, have some sort of collisions.
</p> 
After all this time, developers have found ways to simulate even more <b>complex collisions</b> :
<ul style="margin: 0px">
    <li><b>Box2D</b> is opensource and was made by Erin Catto, but is not 3D</li>
    <li><b>PhysX</b> was made by NVidia, but was discontinued</li>
    <li><b>Bullet</b>, a 3D opensource collision library</li>
    <li><b>Chaos</b>, recently developed by Unreal Engine</li>
    <li><b>Havok</b>, used by Nintendo, Ubisoft, and others, but being premium</li>
    <li><b>And more...</b></li>
</ul>
<br>
However, since the old days, new ways to represent shapes are being used:
<ul style="margin: 0px">
    <li><b>2D boxes</b>, moving freely (example : Mario)</li>
    <li><b>2D Sprite pixels</b>, for pixel to pixel collisions</li>
    <li><b>Complex 2D shapes</b>, with multiple points</li>
    <li><b>3D triangles</b>, the mainstream way to represent 3D models</li>
    <li><b>Sign Distance Functions</b>, being mathematical expressions of a shape</li>
    <li><b>And even more...</b></li>
</ul>

</p>

The way to handle collisions is still <b>evolving</b>. </br>
Some games also require <b>custom collisions</b> to be optimal. </br>
<div>
<i>Example : Minecraft only requires collisions between boxes and cylinders. 
The collision between chunks don't even have to be tested.</i>
