Narrow Phase
</h1>
</div>

<h2> Definition: </h2>
The <b>narrow phase</b> is the part when collisions between shapes will be tested with their <b>actual geometry</b>. 
<br>
It means these collisions are <b>precise</b>, but also <b>performance heavy</b>.

</p>

The <b>brute way</b> to do things would be to test every triangle against each other. <br>
However, that would be <b>too slow</b>.

</p>

Algorithms have been created to make it <b>faster</b>. <br>
Most of them use the <b>properties</b> of <b>convex shapes</b>.

<hr />

<h2> Requirements: </h2>

For this phase to be useful, it must return : 
<ul style="margin: 0px">
    <li>The <b>point</b> of collision</li>
    <li>The <b>normal</b> of the impact</li>
    <li>The <b>penetrated distance</b> between the two shapes</li>
</ul>
</p>
Without that, we wouldn't be able to make a proper <b>collision response</b> afterwards.
