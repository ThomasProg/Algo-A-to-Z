ProjectOnAxis() can vary and be optimized depending on the implentation of Shape. GetEveryAxisInTheWholeWorld() returns a list of every axis possibly existing (which will, of course, be a bottleneck). The implementation of Range and DoRangesOverlap is pretty straight forward: C++ Python C# Java struct Range { float min, max; }; bool DoRangesOverlap(const Range\u0026 range1, const Range\u0026 range2) { return range1.max \u003e range2.min \u0026\u0026 range2.max \u003e range1.min; } class Range(): min = 0 max = 0 def DoRangesOverlap(range1: Range, range2: Range) -\u003e bool: return range1.max \u003e range2.min and range2.max \u003e range1.min public struct Range { public float min; public float max; public static bool DoRangesOverlap(Range range1, Range range2) { return range1.max \u003e range2.min \u0026\u0026 range2.max \u003e range1.min; } }; public class Range { public float min; public float max; public static bool DoRangesOverlap(Range range1, Range range2) { return range1.max \u003e range2.min \u0026\u0026 range2.max \u003e range1.min; } }; The smarter way GetEveryAxisInTheWholeWorld() will, of course, make the algorithm too slow to be used. However, we actually don't have to check every axis. Let's assume our shapes are polygons. In 2D, one of the straight lines separating the shapes will always be tangeant to a side of a shape. In 3D, one of the planes separating the shapes will always be tangeant to a face of a shape. In whatever dimension, one of the hyperplanes separating the shapes will always be tangeant to a face of a shape. ",description:"",tags:null,title:"In practice",uri:"/collisions/narrowphase/sat/inpractice/index.html"},{content:` Non unit axes optimization On the previous examples, for the projection to be accurate, the axes had to be unit vectors.
Let’s asssume an axis is not unit vectors.
That would mean all projections on that axis would be multiplied by the length of that axis.
However, the length of that axis is constant.
This means that the order of the projections are still preserved.
Since we’re only using that order, and not the values in themselves, we can take advantage of that.
Brute force way For 2D : Python def GetEveryAxisInTheWholeWorld(precision) axes = [] mult = 2 * Math.PI / precision for i in range(precision): angle = i * mult axes.append(Vector2D(cos(angle), sin(angle)) return axes For other dimensions : We just have to get axes at a regular interval in a hypersphere.
The smart way Let’s take the shortest path between the two shapes.
If the shapes are colliding, then the length of that path should be 0.
Else, it is not 0.
That means the separating axis will always be linear to that shortest path.
We can also extend the features:
2D+ : we can extend an edge to a line, since the shortest distance between a point and that line wouldn’t change 3D+ : we can extend an face to a plane, since the shortest distance between a point and that plane wouldn’t change etc For 2D : In 2D, we have to compute the axis of the shortest path between:
a point and another point a line and another line a point and a line 2D : A point and a point Let v1, v2 be two points. The axis of the shortest path between v1 and v2 is v2-v1.
However, since points are infinitesimal, we assume this collision never happens.
Even if it ends up happening, the algorithm will detect a collision between a line and a line.
It is an imprecision that can be discarded.
We can discard this case.
2D : A line and a line If the two edges weren’t parallel, the shortest path would be between a vertex and an edge instead.
So we can assume that the lines are parallel.
If that is the case, then the axis of their shortest path is just the normal of that line.
2D : a point and a line The shortest path between a line and a line is a straight line orthogonal to the line.
So the separating axis is just the normal of the line.
Code Python def GetNormal(vector: Vector2) -\u003e Vector2: return Vector2(- vector.y, vector.x) def GetPotentialSeparatingAxesFor1Shape(shape): axes = [] nbVertices = len(shape.vertices) for i in range(nbVertices - 1): side = shape.vertices[i] - shape.vertices[i+1] axes.append(GetNormal(side)) lastSide = shape.vertices[nbVertices - 1] - shape.vertices[0] axes.append(GetNormal(lastSide)) return axes def GetPotentialSeparatingAxes(shape1, shape2): axes = [] axes.append(GetPotentialSeparatingAxesFor1Shape(shape1)) axes.append(GetPotentialSeparatingAxesFor1Shape(shape2)) return axes For 3D : In 3D, we have to compute the axis of the shortest path between:
a point and a point (infinitesimal, discarded) a point and a line (infinitesimal, discarded) a plane and a plane a plane and a point a plane and a line a line and a line 3D : A plane and a plane Same logic as for the lines in 2D.
They must be parallel. Otherwise, we would test with another feature.
If they are, then the axis would be the normal of either of the planes.
3D : A plane and a point We can just use the normal of the plane.
3D : A plane and a line The line is parallel to the plane.
Otherwise, we would test the collision between a line and a line.
If they are, then the axis would be the normal of the plane.
3D : A line and a line If the lines are parallel, we can assume their collision is infinitesimal and discard it.
So we will assume they are not.
If that is the case, then the axis of their shortest path would be the crossproduct between their two directions.
Code Python def CrossProduct(vector1: Vector3, vector2: Vector3) -\u003e Vector3: result = Vector3() result.x = vector1.y * vector2.z - vector1.z * vector2.y result.y = vector1.z * vector2.x - vector1.x * vector2.z result.x = vector1.x * vector2.y - vector1.y * vector2.x return result def GetNormal(vector1: Vector3, vector2: Vector3) -\u003e Vector3: return CrossProduct(vector1, vector2) def GetPotentialSeparatingAxesFor1Shape(shape): axes = [] triangles = shape.GetAllTriangles() for triangle in triangles: axes.append(GetNormal(triangle.edge1, triangle.edge2)) return axes def GetPotentialSeparatingAxes(shape1, shape2): axes = [] # Plane/Plane and Line/Plane cases axes.append(GetPotentialSeparatingAxesFor1Shape(shape1)) axes.append(GetPotentialSeparatingAxesFor1Shape(shape2)) # Line/Line case edgesShape1 = shape1.GetAllEdges() edgesShape2 = shape1.GetAllEdges() for edgeShape1 in edgesShape1: for edgeShape2 in edgesShape2: axes.append(CrossProduct(edgeShape1, edgeShape2)) return axes Generalization : Let’s define hyperplanes dimensions:
A line is a 2D hyperplane A plane is a 3D hyperplane etc For simplicity, let H(N) be a N dimensional hyperplane.
Let D be the dimension of the space.
We have to test:
H(D) / H(i), i \u003c= D H(D-1) / H(D) H(D-1) / H(D-1) etc H(D) / H(i), i \u003c= D We can just take the normal of H(D).
H(i) / H(j) As long as the direct sum of H(i) and H(j) is equal to H(N), we can compute a vector orthogonal to both H(i) and H(j).
Otherwise, we can consider it as infinitesimal, and discard it.
Parallel axes optimization If two axes are parallel, then we only need to test with one of those.\\
It is important for symetric shapes, such as rectangles, circles, spheres, etc.

This is one of the best ways we know to render hyperspheres with other objects. However, for collisions, we do not need this representation, since it only makes the performance worse. Instead, we can just use the mathematical properties of the hypersphere and have O(1) performance.

It returns a point of the shape for a given t. Let P(t) = DotProduct(S(t), axis). P(t) is the projection of the points of that shape on a given axis. Example : S(t) = r * cos(t) * i + r * sin(t) * j S(t) represents a circle with a radius of r, centered around the origin. Properties of S(t) Continuous Periodic S(t) represents a closed set, so S(t) is continuous.
S(t) represents a closed set, so S(t) is periodic.
i.e. : if we choose a point and follow the line, we end up looping and coming back to that first point.
Properties of P(t) Continuous Periodic Maximum Minimum P(t) = DotProduct(S(t), axis).
S(t) is continuous. DotProduct is a continuous map.
So P(t) is continuous.
P(t) = DotProduct(S(t), axis).
S(t) is periodic, and axis is constant.
So P(t) is periodic too, with the same period as S(t).
Every local maximum of P(t) is equal to the maximum of P(t).
Every local minimum of P(t) is equal to the minimum of P(t).
Dichotomy As we saw before, once we find the extremum, we do not have to test the other vertices anymore. The projections are also continuous, and there are only 2 extremums, so: Python # Algorithm created by myself, and proud of it, hehe def NextIndex(shape, index): size = len(shape.vertices) return (index + 1) % size def PrevIndex(shape, index): size = len(shape.vertices) return (index - 1 + size) % size def GetMiddleIndex(shape, id1, id2): if (id1 \u003c id2): return (id1 + id2) / 2 else: size = len(shape.vertices) dist = size - (id1 - id2) return (id1 + dist / 2) % size def IsSmallerClockwise(shape, axis, index): p = ProjectPointOnAxis(shape.vertices[index], axis) pNext = ProjectPointOnAxis(shape.vertices[NextIndex(shape, index)], axis) return pNext \u003c p def IsSmallerAntiClockwise(shape, axis, index): p = ProjectPointOnAxis(shape.vertices[index], axis) pPrev = ProjectPointOnAxis(shape.vertices[PrevIndex(shape, index)], axis) return pPrev \u003c p # This function is tail recursive, so the compiler can optimize it out def SearchMinProjectionOnAxis(shape: Shape, axis: Vector, minIndex, maxIndex) -\u003e float: interval = maxIndex - minIndex i1 = minIndex i2 = GetMiddleIndex(shape, minIndex, maxIndex) # half v1 = shape.vertices[i1] v2 = shape.vertices[i2] p1 = ProjectPointOnAxis(v1, axis) p2 = ProjectPointOnAxis(v2, axis) if (p1 \u003c p2): # Go in the direction of p1 if (IsSmallerClockwise(shape, axis, i1)): return SearchMinProjectionOnAxis(shape, axis, i1, i2) # clockwise if (IsSmallerAntiClockwise(shape, axis, i1)): return SearchMinProjectionOnAxis(shape, axis, i2, i1) # anti clockwise # else, already at the end return p1 elif (p2 \u003c p1): # Go in the direction of p2 if (IsSmallerClockwise(shape, axis, i2)): return SearchMinProjectionOnAxis(shape, axis, i2, i1) # clockwise if (IsSmallerAntiClockwise(shape, axis, i2, i1)): return SearchMinProjectionOnAxis(shape, axis, i1, i2) # anti clockwise # else, already at the end return p2 # The same algorithm can be used to find the maximum projection. # Cases where projections are equal are not checked, but have to be and can be. # This program is not optimized, but has for goal to describe how the algorithm works. def ProjectShapeOnAxis(shape: Shape, axis: Vector) -\u003e Range: range = new Range() range.min = SearchMinProjectionOnAxis(shape, axis, 0, len(shape.vertices)) range.max = SearchMaxProjectionOnAxis(shape, axis, 0, len(shape.vertices)) return range Case Complexity Worst case O(log(N)) Average case O(log(N)) Best case O(1) Info This algorithm is very optimized for a high number of vertices. However, in practice, there are only a few games that have that many vertices in 2D. Due to the different checks, this algorithm is sure to be less optimized for a few amount of vertices.
Examples : A convex shape, with a first and a last vertex A vertex is chosen. There are as many vertices on the right as on the left. We project the first vertex and the chosen vertex on the axis We select the vertex with the minimum projection, and evaluate in which direction the real minimum projection is We take the part of the circle between the first vertex and the chosen vertex that is in the direction of the minimum We repeat the algorithm, with the chosen vertex being the new last one A convex shape, that has a lot of vertices at one place We project the vertices ; the chosen vertex has the minimal projection We compute the direction of the real minimal projection We keep the part of the circle that was in that direction, and repeat Projecting an arbitrary 2D shape The brute force way An arbitrary shape can be constructed with the function S(t), described above. The brute force way of projecting the shape is just to project every point returned by that function. Of course, it is impossible to project every point. That is why we set a precision. Info This method does not return the exact projection of the shape, but it is the best we can do without any more precisions on the shape. The performance is also horrible for what it is.
Python # shape.s(t) returns the vertices of shape # shape.s(t) is periodic with a period of 1 def ProjectShapeOnAxis(shape: Shape, axis: Vector, precision: int) -\u003e Range: range = new Range() range.min = Math.max() range.max = Math.min() step = 1 / precision for i in range(precision)) proj = ProjectPointOnAxis(shape.s(i*step), axis) if (proj \u003c range.min): range.min = proj if (proj \u003e range.max): range.max = proj return range The smarter way Being a convex shape, the same algorithm applied in the Dichotomy section can be used. vertices[i] will be replaced by S(t). Instead of adding 1 to the index, we will add a very small value to t. Same for removing it. We could also compute the derivative of P(t) to determine the direction, if possible. Also, a maximum depth will be used instead of a precision to prevent infinite recursion. Info This method does not return the exact projection of the shape either. However, the precision can be very accurate because of the depth we can easily increase thanks to the O(log(n)) complexity of the algorithm.

Every time, we project the shapes one the normal of an edge.

Tip To optimize that, we could use world partitioning and only load / compute this data when getting close to the associated object.
