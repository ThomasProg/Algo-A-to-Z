Generalization for higher dimensions Theorem: If two convex shapes do not collide, then, a hyperplane can separate them.
Contrapositive: If two convex shapes collide, then, there is no hyperplane separating them.
Examples : A straight line separates the shapes, so there are no collisions No straight line separates the shapes, so there is a collision The shape on the right is not convex, the theorem doesn't work Separating Axis Theorem Definition : Statement: The line, plane, or hyperplane described above always has a normal axis.
Theorem: If the shapes are not colliding, the projections of the shapes on this axis do not overlap.
Contrapositive: If the shapes are colliding, then, no matter the axis we take, the projections of the shapes on this axis will overlap Warning Whether there are collisions or not, there will always exist an axis for which the projections of the shapes overlap.

If on one axis, the projections do not overlap, then there are no collisions. Otherwise, there is a collision.

ProjectOnAxis() can vary and be optimized depending on the implentation of Shape.
GetEveryAxisInTheWholeWorld() returns a list of every axis possibly existing (which will, of course, be a bottleneck).
The implementation of Range and DoRangesOverlap is pretty straight forward:
C++ Python C# Java struct Range { float min, max; }; bool DoRangesOverlap(const Range\u0026 range1, const Range\u0026 range2) { return range1.max \u003e range2.min \u0026\u0026 range2.max \u003e range1.min; } class Range(): min = 0 max = 0 def DoRangesOverlap(range1: Range, range2: Range) -\u003e bool: return range1.max \u003e range2.min and range2.max \u003e range1.min public struct Range { public float min; public float max; public static bool DoRangesOverlap(Range range1, Range range2) { return range1.max \u003e range2.min \u0026\u0026 range2.max \u003e range1.min; } }; public class Range { public float min; public float max; public static bool DoRangesOverlap(Range range1, Range range2) { return range1.max \u003e range2.min \u0026\u0026 range2.max \u003e range1.min; } }; The smarter way GetEveryAxisInTheWholeWorld() will, of course, make the algorithm too slow to be used. However, we actually don’t have to check every axis.
ProjectOnAxis() can also be optimized.
More informations on that in the next chapters.
`,description:"",tags:null,title:"In practice",uri:"/collisions/narrowphase/sat/inpractice/index.html"},{content:` Non unit axes optimization On the previous examples, for the projection to be accurate, the axes had to be unit vectors.
Let’s asssume an axis is not unit vectors.
That would mean all projections on that axis would be multiplied by the length of that axis.
However, the length of that axis is constant.
This means that the order of the projections are still preserved.
Since we’re only using that order, and not the values in themselves, we can take advantage of that.
Brute force way For 2D : Python def GetEveryAxisInTheWholeWorld(precision) axes = [] mult = 2 * Math.PI / precision for i in range(precision): angle = i * mult axes.append(Vector2D(cos(angle), sin(angle)) return axes For other dimensions : We just have to get axes at a regular interval in a hypersphere.
The smart way Let’s take the shortest path between the two shapes.
If the shapes are colliding, then the length of that path should be 0.
Else, it is not 0.
That means the separating axis will always be linear to that shortest path.
We can also extend the features:
2D+ : we can extend an edge to a line, since the shortest distance between a point and that line wouldn’t change 3D+ : we can extend an face to a plane, since the shortest distance between a point and that plane wouldn’t change etc For 2D : In 2D, we have to compute the axis of the shortest path between:
a point and another point a line and another line a point and a line 2D : A point and a point Let v1, v2 be two points. The axis of the shortest path between v1 and v2 is v2-v1.
However, since points are infinitesimal, we assume this collision never happens.
Even if it ends up happening, the algorithm will detect a collision between a line and a line.
It is an imprecision that can be discarded.
We can discard this case.
2D : A line and a line If the two edges weren’t parallel, the shortest path would be between a vertex and an edge instead.
So we can assume that the lines are parallel.
If that is the case, then the axis of their shortest path is just the normal of that line.
2D : a point and a line The shortest path between a line and a line is a straight line orthogonal to the line.
So the separating axis is just the normal of the line.
Code Python def GetNormal(vector: Vector2) -\u003e Vector2: return Vector2(- vector.y, vector.x) def GetPotentialSeparatingAxesFor1Shape(shape): axes = [] nbVertices = len(shape.vertices) for i in range(nbVertices - 1): side = shape.vertices[i] - shape.vertices[i+1] axes.append(GetNormal(side)) lastSide = shape.vertices[nbVertices - 1] - shape.vertices[0] axes.append(GetNormal(lastSide)) return axes def GetPotentialSeparatingAxes(shape1, shape2): axes = [] axes.append(GetPotentialSeparatingAxesFor1Shape(shape1)) axes.append(GetPotentialSeparatingAxesFor1Shape(shape2)) return axes For 3D : In 3D, we have to compute the axis of the shortest path between:
a point and a point (infinitesimal, discarded) a point and a line (infinitesimal, discarded) a plane and a plane a plane and a point a plane and a line a line and a line 3D : A plane and a plane Same logic as for the lines in 2D.
They must be parallel. Otherwise, we would test with another feature.
If they are, then the axis would be the normal of either of the planes.
3D : A plane and a point We can just use the normal of the plane.
3D : A plane and a line The line is parallel to the plane.
Otherwise, we would test the collision between a line and a line.
If they are, then the axis would be the normal of the plane.
3D : A line and a line If the lines are parallel, we can assume their collision is infinitesimal and discard it.
So we will assume they are not.
If that is the case, then the axis of their shortest path would be the crossproduct between their two directions.
Code Python def CrossProduct(vector1: Vector3, vector2: Vector3) -\u003e Vector3: result = Vector3() result.x = vector1.y * vector2.z - vector1.z * vector2.y result.y = vector1.z * vector2.x - vector1.x * vector2.z result.x = vector1.x * vector2.y - vector1.y * vector2.x return result def GetNormal(vector1: Vector3, vector2: Vector3) -\u003e Vector3: return CrossProduct(vector1, vector2) def GetPotentialSeparatingAxesFor1Shape(shape): axes = [] triangles = shape.GetAllTriangles() for triangle in triangles: axes.append(GetNormal(triangle.edge1, triangle.edge2)) return axes def GetPotentialSeparatingAxes(shape1, shape2): axes = [] # Plane/Plane and Line/Plane cases axes.append(GetPotentialSeparatingAxesFor1Shape(shape1)) axes.append(GetPotentialSeparatingAxesFor1Shape(shape2)) # Line/Line case edgesShape1 = shape1.GetAllEdges() edgesShape2 = shape1.GetAllEdges() for edgeShape1 in edgesShape1: for edgeShape2 in edgesShape2: axes.append(CrossProduct(edgeShape1, edgeShape2)) return axes Generalization : Let’s define hyperplanes dimensions:
A line is a 2D hyperplane A plane is a 3D hyperplane etc For simplicity, let H(N) be a N dimensional hyperplane.
Instead of hyperplanes, we could say that H(N) is a subspace of dimension N - 1
Let D be the dimension of the space.
We have to test:
H(D) / H(i), i \u003c= D H(D-1) / H(D) H(D-1) / H(D-1) etc H(D) / H(i), i \u003c= D We can just take the normal of H(D).
H(i) / H(j) As long as the direct sum of H(i) and H(j) is equal to H(N), we probably can’t discard that case.
Same as before, we need to compute the axis of the shortest path between the two hyperplanes.
Parallel axes optimization If two axes are parallel, then we only need to test with one of those.\\
It is important for symetric shapes, such as rectangles, circles, spheres, etc.

This is one of the best ways we know to render hyperspheres with other objects.
However, for collisions, we do not need this representation, since it only makes the performance worse.
Instead, we can just use the mathematical properties of the hypersphere and have O(1) performance.

Let P(t) = DotProduct(S(t), axis).
P(t) is the projection of the points of that shape on a given axis.
Example : S(t) = r * cos(t) * i + r * sin(t) * j S(t) represents a circle with a radius of r, centered around the origin.
Properties of S(t) Continuous Periodic S(t) represents a closed set, so S(t) is continuous.
S(t) represents a closed set, so S(t) is periodic.
i.e. : if we choose a point and follow the line, we end up looping and coming back to that first point.
Properties of P(t) Continuous Periodic Maximum Minimum P(t) = DotProduct(S(t), axis).
S(t) is continuous. DotProduct is a continuous map.
So P(t) is continuous.
P(t) = DotProduct(S(t), axis).
S(t) is periodic, and axis is constant.
So P(t) is periodic too, with the same period as S(t).
Every local maximum of P(t) is equal to the maximum of P(t).
Every local minimum of P(t) is equal to the minimum of P(t).
Dichotomy As we saw before, once we find the extremum, we do not have to test the other vertices anymore.
The projections are also continuous, and there are only 2 extremums, so:

However, in practice, there are only a few games that have that many vertices in 2D. Due to the different checks, this algorithm is sure to be less optimized for a few amount of vertices.
Examples : A convex shape, with a first and a last vertex A vertex is chosen. There are as many vertices on the right as on the left We project the first vertex and the chosen vertex on the axis We select the vertex with the minimum projection, and evaluate in which direction the real minimum projection is We take the part of the circle between the first vertex and the chosen vertex that is in the direction of the minimum We repeat the algorithm, with the chosen vertex being the new last one A convex shape, that has a lot of vertices at one place We project the vertices ; the chosen vertex has the minimal projection We compute the direction of the real minimal projection We keep the part of the circle that was in that direction, and repeat Projecting an arbitrary 2D shape The brute force way An arbitrary shape can be constructed with the function S(t), described above. The brute force way of projecting the shape is just to project every point returned by that function. Of course, it is impossible to project every point. That is why we set a precision.
Info This method does not return the exact projection of the shape, but it is the best we can do without any more precisions on the shape. The performance is also horrible for what it is.

vertices[i] will be replaced by S(t).
Instead of adding 1 to the index, we will add a very small value to t.
Same for removing it.
We could also compute the derivative of P(t) to determine the direction, if possible.
Also, a maximum depth will be used instead of a precision to prevent infinite recursion.
Info This method does not return the exact projection of the shape either. However, the precision can be very accurate because of the depth we can easily increase thanks to the O(log(n)) complexity of the algorithm.

Even the oldest games, like Tetris and Pacman, have some sort of collisions.
After all this time, developers have found ways to simulate even more complex collisions :
Box2D is opensource and was made by Erin Catto, but is not 3D PhysX was made by NVidia, but was discontinued Bullet, a 3D opensource collision library Chaos, recently developed by Unreal Engine Havok, used by Nintendo, Ubisoft, and others, but being premium Jolt Physics, a new 3D opensource used Horizon Forbidden West And more… However, since the old days, new ways to represent shapes are being used:
2D boxes, moving freely (example : Mario) 2D Sprite pixels, for pixel to pixel collisions Complex 2D shapes, with multiple points 3D triangles, the mainstream way to represent 3D models Sign Distance Functions, being mathematical expressions of a shape And even more… The way to handle collisions is still evolving. Some games also require custom collisions to be optimal.
Example : Minecraft only requires collisions between boxes and cylinders. The collision between chunks don’t even have to be tested.
How: The collisions will be implemented that way (unless if specified otherwise):
struct ShapePair { Shape* shape1; Shape* shape2; }; class CollisionDetector { std::vector\u003cShape\u003e registeredShapes; BroadPhase broadPhase; NarrowPhase narrowPhase; void Register(const Shape\u0026 shape) { broadPhase.Register(shape); } void Unregister(const Shape\u0026 shape) { broadPhase.Unregister(shape); } void SimulateCollisions() { // A container of potentially colliding pairs // Could return a std::vector, std::list, etc auto\u0026 pairs = broadPhase.GetPotentiallyCollidingPairs(); for (ShapePair\u0026 pair : pairs) { CollisionInfo collisionInfo; if (narrowPhase.AreShapesColliding(pair.shape1, pair.shape2, collisionInfo)) { RunPhysicalResponse(pair.shape1, pair.shape2, collisionInfo); } } } }; References : https://dyn4j.org/2010/01/sat/

Indeed, the normal is the same as the separating axis.
Getting the MVT (Minimum Translation Vector) The MVT is equal to the overlapping interval of the projections between the two shapes.
Getting the collision point for 2D Let’s suppose we only have collisions between an edge and a point.
Every time, we project the shapes one the normal of an edge.
If we keep reference of which normal belongs to what shape, then we can find the edge that got collided.
Since we compute the MVT, we also compute the projection of that point on the axis.
It means we can retrieve it.

It means these collisions are precise, but also performance heavy.
The brute way to do things would be to test every triangle against each other. However, that would be too slow.
Algorithms have been created to make it faster. Most of them use the properties of convex shapes.
Requirements: For this phase to be useful, it must return :
The point of collision The normal of the impact The penetrated distance between the two shapes Without that, we wouldn’t be able to make a proper collision response afterwards.

Every time we will test a collision, we will project the 1st shape onto the axes. However, half of the axes will stay the same, because half of the axes will be computed from that 1st shape. That means we can precompute both the axes, but also the projections of the shape on half of the axes between the broadphase and the narrow phase.
Warning The previous algorithm would have returned as soon as it detects there are no collisions. This means less data could have been computed. By precomputing this data, we asssume shapes most likely collide to be efficient. This is one of the reasons the broadphase is so important. Otherwise, it could end up taking more performance instead.
Static Objects When objects are moving, we have to compute axes in world space again every frame.
However, when objects are not moving (i.e. static), their world position do not change.
That means the following won’t change:
half of the axes the projections of the shape on these axes We can cache that data.
Warning We have no idea when a collision would occur. Precomputing everything would cost a lot of memory, for collisions that might never happen.
Tip To optimize that, we could use world partitioning and only load / compute this data when getting close to the associated object.
Caching the separating axis You can save the separating axis for a pair for the next frame.
That way, at the next frame, you can test if that separating axis is still valid, and potentially have O(1) complexity.

Note that the following works for every dimension.
C++ struct Range { float min, max; }; bool DoRangesOverlap(const Range\u0026 range1, const Range\u0026 range2) { return range1.max \u003e range2.min \u0026\u0026 range2.max \u003e range1.min; } bool TestCollisionsWithSAT(const Shape\u0026 shape1, const Shape\u0026 shape2) { std::vector\u003cVector\u003e axes = GetEveryAxisInTheWholeWorld(); for (const Vector\u0026 axis : axes) { Range projection1 = shape1.ProjectOnAxis(axis); Range projection2 = shape2.ProjectOnAxis(axis); // if there is a separating hyperplane if (!DoRangesOverlap(projection1, projection2)) { // then there is no collision return false; } } return true; } Modifying the SAT From now on, we will start to changing parts of the code.
However, even with modifications, the code will always be working the same as before.
First, we will explicit ProjectOnAxis() :
projection = shape.Project(axis); becomes
float maxProj = shape.GetMaxProj(axis); float minProj = shape.GetMinProj(axis); Obviously, GetMinProj(axis) is equivalent to GetMaxProj(- axis).
This is just the range, but explicited. Nothing unusual.
For the sake of explanation, we can even get the point out of the functions.
// The point with the max projection on axis Vector ptMaxProj = shape.GetPtMaxProj(axis); // The point with the min projection on axis Vector ptMinProj = shape.GetPtMinProj(axis); // projecting the points back one the axis, so we have the same values than before float maxProj = DotProduct(ptMaxProj, axis); float minProj = DotProduct(ptMinProj, axis); Now, we can:
explicit DoRangesOverlap(), change the inequality and applying boolean logic replace the code And we get:
C++ Vector ptMaxProj1 = shape.GetPtMaxProj(axis); Vector ptMinProj1 = shape.GetPtMinProj(axis); float maxProjShape1 = DotProduct(ptMaxProj1, axis); float minProjShape1 = DotProduct(ptMinProj1, axis); Vector ptMaxProj2 = shape.GetPtMaxProj(axis); Vector ptMinProj2 = shape.GetPtMinProj(axis); float maxProjShape2 = DotProduct(ptMaxProj2, axis); float minProjShape2 = DotProduct(ptMinProj2, axis); // if there is a separating hyperplane if (maxProjShape1 - minProjShape2 \u003c 0 || minProjShape1 - maxProjShape2 \u003e 0) { // then there is no collision return false; } Now, let’s replace:
maxProjShape1 - minProjShape2 by:
DotProduct(shape1.GetPtMaxProj(axis), axis) - DotProduct(shape2.GetPtMinProj(axis), axis) Now, let’s do a bit of simple maths:
Let u, v and p be vectors of N dimension.
We have:
$$u \\cdot p - v \\cdot p$$ $$= \\sum (u_{i} * p_{i}) - \\sum (v_{i} * p_{i})$$ $$= \\sum (u_{i} * p_{i} - v_{i} * p_{i})$$ $$= \\sum ((u_{i} - v_{i}) * p_{i})$$It means that we can replace our the last code part by:
Vector minkowskyPtWithMaxProj = shape1.GetPtMaxProj(axis) - shape2.GetPtMinProj(axis); float minkowskySumMaxProj = DotProduct(minkowskyPtWithMaxProj, axis); we just computed a point from the minkowskySum!!!!!!
Or rather, if A and B are our shapes, the expression we have is A - B.
We can now show the final code:
C++ bool TestCollisionsWithSAT(const Shape\u0026 shape1, const Shape\u0026 shape2) { std::vector\u003cVector\u003e axes = GetEveryAxisInTheWholeWorld(); for (const Vector\u0026 axis : axes) { Vector minkowskyPtWithMaxProj = shape1.GetPtMaxProj(axis) - shape2.GetPtMinProj(axis); float minkowskySumMaxProj = DotProduct(minkowskyPtWithMaxProj, axis); // Note that this is the minimum projection instead of the maximum we just computed above Vector minkowskyPtWithMinProj = shape1.GetPtMinProj(axis) - shape2.GetMaxProj(axis); float minkowskySumMinProj = DotProduct(minkowskyPtWithMinProj, axis); // If 0 is outside the projection if (minkowskySumMaxProj \u003c 0 || minkowskySumMinProj \u003e 0) { return false; } } return true; } REVELATION!!!!!
There was an imposter among us!
And it was Minkowski!!!
Let’s explain that.
A different point of view We’re doing the minkowski sum A - B.
If the shapes are overlapping, it means that there is atleast 1 point both shapes are sharing.
In that case, for that point, A - B would return the origin, since the point from A and B would negate each other.
So if there is a collision, the origin should be inside the minkowski shape!
However, that just delays the problem…
The minkowski shape is convex since both A and B are convex.
A point is, in itself, convex.
Is there an algorithm capable of determining if there is a collision between 2 convex shapes?
Yes!!
The Separating Axis Theorem is!!!
C++ bool TestCollisionsWithSAT(const Shape\u0026 shape1, const Shape\u0026 shape2) { std::vector\u003cVector\u003e axes = GetEveryAxisInTheWholeWorld(); Shape minkowskySum = shape1 - shape2; for (const Vector\u0026 axis : axes) { // The projection of the origin is 0 on any axis // So if the projection of the origin is not in projection of the Minkowski shape: if (minkowskySum.GetPtMaxProj(axis) \u003c 0 || minkowskySum.GetPtMinProj(axis) \u003e 0) { return false; } } return true; } Note that this code is still doing the same thing as what we had before.
Here, the minkowsky shape is just computed before the loop, and then projecting it, instead of getting the projections on the fly.
The condition also became very straightforward.
Conclusion Let A and B be two closed convex shapes.
We just proved that:
“If two convex shapes do not collide, then, a hyperplane can separate them.”
Is strictly equivalent to:
“If the shapes are not colliding, then, the origin is inside the minkowsky sum A - B.”
And a convex shape is defined by its tangent hyperplanes.
So we can just verify if the origin is “inside” the hyperplanes.
That proof works for any euclidean space!!!
`,description:"",tags:null,title:"Minkowski And SAT",uri:"/collisions/narrowphase/sat/minkowskiandsat/index.html"},{content:` The basic SAT algorithm We saw previously that the SAT could be explained using the Minkowski sum.
C++ bool TestCollisionsWithSAT(const Shape\u0026 shape1, const Shape\u0026 shape2) { std::vector\u003cVector\u003e axes = GetEveryAxisInTheWholeWorld(); Shape minkowskySum = shape1 - shape2; for (const Vector\u0026 axis : axes) { // The projection of the origin is 0 on any axis // So if the projection of the origin is not in projection of the Minkowski shape: if (minkowskySum.GetPtMaxProj(axis) \u003c 0 || minkowskySum.GetPtMinProj(axis) \u003e 0) { return false; } } return true; } The algorithm isn’t usable as it is, since GetEveryAxisInTheWholeWorld() is slow… and even slower for higher dimensions.
However, do you remember how we previously got the axes the 2D case, by just taking the normals?
It doesn’t usually work in higher dimensions for two convex shapes…
However It does work here.
The same as previously, we want to know the shortest path the shape and the point.
However, in the case, there is only one case possible: the path will always be a normal of the shape!
Code : The obvious way To replace GetEveryAxisInTheWholeWorld(), we can just do the following:
C++ bool TestCollisionsWithSAT(const Shape\u0026 shape1, const Shape\u0026 shape2) { Shape minkowskySum = shape1 - shape2; std::vector\u003cVector\u003e axes = minkowskySum.GetNormals(); for (const Vector\u0026 axis : axes) { // The projection of the origin is 0 on any axis // So if the projection of the origin is not in projection of the Minkowski shape: if (minkowskySum.GetPtMaxProj(axis) \u003c 0 || minkowskySum.GetPtMinProj(axis) \u003e 0) { return false; } } return true; } However, the problem with that is that we have to compute the sum of minkowsky.
The obvious way would be to compute possible points and then to create a convex hull around them.
A convex hull can be created for any dimension with the QuickHull algorithm.
It would then look like this:
C++ Shape MinkowskySum(const Shape\u0026 shape1, const Shape\u0026 shape2) { std::vector\u003cPoints\u003e points; std::vector\u003cPoints\u003e\u0026 vertices1 = shape1.GetVertices(); std::vector\u003cPoints\u003e\u0026 vertices2 = shape2.GetVertices(); points.reserve(vertices1.size() + vertices2.size()); for (const Vector\u0026 vertexPos1 : vertices1) { for (const Vector\u0026 vertexPos2 : vertices2) { points.push_back(vertexPos1, vertexPos2); } } return Shape(QuickHull(points)); } Optimizing We could try using the property of convex shapes to :
reduce the number of points as the source of the convex hull compute the convex hull even faster with a different algorithm (or maybe even directly) Another thing we could do is, rather than computing the convex hull, we could try directly computing the normals.
After all, that’s what we are doing already in 2D and in 3D.
These possible optimizations have not been proven yet, and it’s not sure it is actually possible.
But the inverse is also true.
`,description:"",tags:null,title:"Minkowski And Axes",uri:"/collisions/narrowphase/sat/minkoswkiandaxes/index.html"},{content:` Continuous collision for non rotating shapes To increase the precision, we could:
bool SimulatePhysics(Shape\u0026 shape1, Shape\u0026 shape2, CollisionInfo\u0026 collisionInfo) { CollisionInfo satCollisionInfo; if (AreCollidingWithSAT(shape1, shape2, satCollisionInfo)) { float speed1 = DotProduct(shape1.velocity, satCollisionInfo.normal); float speed2 = DotProduct(shape2.velocity, satCollisionInfo.normal); // if (!(maxp1 \u003e minp2 \u0026\u0026 maxp2 \u003e minp1)) // becomes : // if (!(maxp1 - speed1 * t \u003e minp2 - speed2 * t \u0026\u0026 maxp2 - speed2 * t \u003e minp1 - speed1 * t)) // Equations : // maxp1 - speed1 * t = minp2 - speed2 * t // maxp1 - minp2 = speed1 * t - speed2 * t // maxp1 - minp2 = (speed1 - speed2) * t // maxp1 - minp2 = (speed1 - speed2) * t // t1 = (maxp1 - minp2) / (speed1 - speed2) // // And for the other: // maxp2 - speed2 * t \u003e minp1 - speed1 * t) // t2 = (maxp2 - minp1) / (speed2 - speed1) float t1 = (satCollisionInfo.maxp1 - satCollisionInfo.minp2) / (speed1 - speed2); float t2 = (satCollisionInfo.maxp2 - satCollisionInfo.minp1) / (speed2 - speed1); // one of the t is negative, the other positive // we want the positive value, since the negative value would be for the future float t = (t1 \u003e 0) ? t1 : t2; shape1.position -= t * shape1.velocity; shape2.position -= t * shape2.velocity; // We know get: collisionInfo.hitNormal = satCollisionInfo.hitNormal; collisionInfo.mtv = 0; // the collision is exact, continuous collisionInfo.impactMagnitude = satCollisionInfo.mtv; collisionInfo.collisionPoint = satCollisionInfo.collisionPoint - t * satCollisionInfo.hitNormal; return true; } return false; } If the shapes don’t have any angular velocity, we can consider their separating axis never change.
We have both shapes projected on an axis; we just have to take time into account, and find the moment their ranges intersect.
This means we have a continuous collision… but only when the shapes are not rotating.
The lower the rotation is, the more precise the collision is.
Expansive Continuous collision Let’s take a look into 2D.
Let’s superpose the frame before, and the frame after collision.
If we draw a line between the vertices, then we get 3D shapes, that are still convex.
Let’s call the new axis we got T.
This axis represents the time.
If we follow this axis, we notice the shapes are not intersecting, then they are, and then, if we increase time, they will not anymore.
This gives us an interval range, and we have to get the smallest value.
At that moment, t, there is a collision.
We can then compute the position both shapes had at that moment, keep the normal but removing the time component, and same for the collision point.
Since we can compute the SAT for any dimension, then that means we can compute the continuous collision.
You might also notice that the previous part is also a special case of that continuous collision, for when the separating plane is the same.
For both, we compute the time of the intersection and set the collision informations.
